Compute a pairwise SNP distance matrix from one or two alignment(s)

A key point of difference for `psdm` is the pairwise SNP distance between **two**
alignment files. This is particularly beneficial if you have computed a SNP distance
matrix for many samples already and want to update the distances with some new samples -
without rerunning the analysis for all samples in the original file.

Another potential use is having two alignment files for the same samples but with
sequences generated by different techniques. For example, if you have produced consensus
sequences from SNP calls from Illumina and Nanopore and want to see how similar the
Illumina-to-Nanopore (inter-technology) distances are - compared to the intra-technology
distances.
